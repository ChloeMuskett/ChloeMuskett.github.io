Hi everyone, I am a student electrical engineer who is interested in biohacking.  <br /> 
 <br /> 
For my project I am interested in seeing how much the shape and structure of an agar medium can be ultered. This was inspired by some pre-existing agar art projects where bacteria is grown in set areas to create interesting effects. Which can be seen here: <br/>

I am considering a variety of techniques to use in this project, including moulds, 3D printing and string/fabric frames.
